# SaveMe



## Introduction
   Save Me stands as the innovative solution developed by me and my team, Bits Please, during the ESolutions 2023 Hackathon, where we managed to win the hearts of the people and also take the first place.

## What was the idea?
 Every parent's first priority is their children, and there have been numerous news reports about kidnappings happening all around the world. Our application makes a significant improvement in vulnerable people's safety

Technologies Used: React Native, Firebase Database, Firebase Storage, Expo Cli, Twillio

## Functionalities:

<pre>
- Login and register using firebase 
- Chatting function and user searching, ability to delete messages and send emojis
- Ability to add friends/emergency people to 2 types of lists - emergency loud and emergency silent.
- The difference between these two is the kind of danger you are in. If you are in the subway or a public place, then emergency loud starts a very loud alarm so everyone knows that you are in danger. But if you are already kidnapped and want to send your location to your contacts, you might not want the kidnapper to hear that, so here comes the emergency silent list.
- Add profile pictures and be able edit them, with the pictures stored in the cloud.
- Send SMS to your emergency contacts' phone numbers along with a link to your location (opens Google Maps with a link to your current location). Your location is sent every 5 minutes to your contacts so that they can trace the direction you are going, similar to live location sharing.
- Besides alarm starting and location sharing when pressing the emergency button, your phone starts both the back camera and front camera and starts taking pictures every 2 seconds, uploading them to the cloud so that your friends can access those pictures and give the photos to the police to find the attacker faster.

## What we wanted to do but we didn't have time:

- Widget on home screen to acces the emergency buttons without opening the app
- Google and Facebook Login
